## About Me
I am a Master's graduate in Information Science from **Cornell University**. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in International Business from **National Taiwan University** with a minor in Sociology.

My experiences span **data analysis**, **management consulting**, **brand strategy**, and **academic research**, and I am interested in how to leverage data-driven insights in diverse contexts.

Currently, I am based in Tokyo as a **Data and AI Consultant** at arcbricks, aiming to harness the potential of Databricks and data to foster digital transformation.

## Project Experience

### Ecolab Food Safety Audit Question Recommendation System
- Constructed a recommendation system that provides actions for over 600 FDA audit questions for Ecolab, one of the industry leaders in offering water, hygiene, and infection prevention solutions
- Leveraged data parsing and embedding techniques to preprocess data from over five different data sources
- Utilized Databricks to build a scalable Zero-Shot recommendation system that provides recommended actions, reasoning, citations, and sources for each corresponding audit question

### Estimation and Visualization of Flood Damage in Taiwan [(link)](https://github.com/cjw612/Flood_Analysis)

- Aggregated data from five different souces, compiling over seven million flood observation entries
- Utilized spatial and temporal data to identify 84 unique flood events across Taiwan
- Developed a dynamic Tableau dashboard to visualize estimated flood damage over five years

### Customer Segmentation and Business Analysis Report Based on Transaction Data [(link)](https://github.com/cjw612/Customer_Segmentation_Business_Analysis_Report/blob/main/README.md)

- Generated a business analysis report from 541,909 entries of transaction data of an online retailer based in England
- Defined four behavioral indexes (RFM Indexes, Activity Index) as features for K-Means Clustering and identified three distinct clusters
- Delivered three levels of next-step business strategy suggestions based on the segmentation results and the overall patterns in the data

### Prediction of League of Legends Game Outcome with Supervised Learning Methods [(link)](https://github.com/cjw612/LeagueofLegendsGameOutcomeClassification)

- Predicted the outcome of League of Legends games based on in-game data from a dataset with 28 features across 24,224 entries.
- Engineered supervised learning methods such as Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and XGBoost, yielding a final prediction accuracy of over 78% across all four models.
- Leveraged hyperparameter tuning methods such as Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization to further optimize model performance.

### News Category Classification with Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning [(link)](https://github.com/cjw612/News_Category_Classification)

- Categorized the category of news entries based on the headline and description from a dataset with over 200,000 entries, deploying both classical and deep learning machine learning models.
- Implemented Principle Component Analysis to perform dimension reduction and feature transformation.
- Applied Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron with Bayesian Optimization hyperparameter tuning, achieving a final prediction accuracy of 74% on the best-performing model.

### Impact of Xiaohongshu Usage on Young Female's Body Dissatisfaction  [(link)](/assets/xiaohongshu.pdf)

- Analyzed how social media influences females’ body dissatisfaction with Xiaohongshu as an instance under the instruction of Professor Nanyi Bi from the Department of Information Management at National Taiwan University.
- Conducted bottom-up thematic analysis and constructed 9 code groups with over 100 codes across 11 in-depth interviews with MAXQDA.
- Crafted a conceptual model depicting the interplay between social media usage, body dissatisfaction, and body comparison while considering the characteristics of Xiaohongshu's content and usage patterns.
