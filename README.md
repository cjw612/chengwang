## Project Experience
### Prediction of League of Legends Game Outcome with Supervised Learning Methods [(link)](https://github.com/cjw612/LeagueofLegendsGameOutcomeClassification)

- Predicted the outcome of League of Legends games based on in-game data from a dataset with 28 features across 24,224 entries.
- Deployed supervised learning methods such as Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and XGBoost, yielding a final prediction accuracy of over 78% across all four models.
- Implemented hyperparameter tuning methods such as Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization to further optimize model performance.

### News Category Classification with NLP and Deep Learning [(link)](https://github.com/cjw612/News_Category_Classification)

- Predicted the category of news entries based on the headline and description from a dataset with over 200,000 entries, deploying both classical and deep learning machine learning models.
- Utilized methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Principle Component Analysis to perform dimension reduction and feature transformation.
- Deployed Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron with Bayesian Optimization hyperparameter tuning, achieving a final prediction accuracy of 74% on the best-performing model. 

### Impact of Xiaohongshu Usage on Young Female's Body Dissatisfaction  [(link)](/assets/xiaohongshu.pdf)

- Identified how social media influences females’ body dissatisfaction with Xiaohongshu as an instance under the instruction of Professor Nanyi Bi from National Taiwan University.
- Conducted bottom-up thematic analysis and constructed 9 code groups with over 100 codes across 11 in-depth interviews with MAXQDA.
- Crafted a thorough conceptual model of the interplay between social media usage, body dissatisfaction, and body comparison while considering the characteristics of Xiaohongshu's content and usage patterns.
